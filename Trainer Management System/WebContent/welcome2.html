      <p align= "justify"><em>"Atos Syntel is a division of Atos and a multinational provider of integrated technology and business services. The company is led by Rakesh Khanna. Atos Syntel was created by the acquisition of Syntel, Inc. by Atos S.E, which was announced on July 22, 2018 and completed on October 9, 2018. Syntel's early growth prompted their leadership to explore additional service offerings to augment the core IT staffing business. In 1989, Syntel began providing development and maintenance services to its clients.

In 1992, with new development centers in India, Syntel began software outsourcing services with an onsite-offshore model, which connected software developers in India to project managers at client locations via an international telecommunications network.

Atos Syntel provides IT services such as traditional application development and maintenance, data warehousing and business intelligence, as well as digital services like social media, mobile, cloud, analytics, IoT and AI and automation-powered solutions.[buzzword]

The company markets its services to enterprises in the banking and financial services, insurance, healthcare and life sciences, retail, logistics and telecom, and manufacturing sectors. Integral to its operating model are the use of offshore centers to deliver IT and KPO services."</em></p>
